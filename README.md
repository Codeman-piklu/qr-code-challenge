## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned
This project helped me understand the importance of aligning designs using CSS properties like padding, margin, and flexbox. Below are some examples of what I learned:
## HTML:
<div class="qr-container">  
  <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code to Frontend Mentor">  
  <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>  
  <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>  
</div>

## CSS:
.qr-container {  
  background-color: #ffffff;  
  border-radius: 15px;  
  padding: 20px;  
  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);  
}  
.qr-container img {  
  width: 100%;  
  border-radius: 10px;  
}  
### Continued development
In future projects, I want to:
    Focus more on advanced CSS techniques like CSS Grid for complex layouts.
    Implement animations or transitions to make components more interactive.
### Useful resources
- CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox - Helped me understand the flexbox properties used for centering elements.
- MDN Web Docs: Box-shadow - A great reference for styling shadows.
